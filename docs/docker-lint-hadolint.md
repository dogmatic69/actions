# Dockerfile Linter [docker action]

A smarter Dockerfile linter that helps you build [best practice][] Docker
images. The linter is parsing the Dockerfile into an AST and performs rules
on top of the AST. It is standing on the shoulders of [ShellCheck][] to lint
the Bash code inside `RUN` instructions.
