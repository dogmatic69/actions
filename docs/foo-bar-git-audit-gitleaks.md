# GitLeaks [docker action]

Audit git repos for secrets. Gitleaks provides a way for you to find unencrypted secrets and other unwanted data types in git repositories. As part of its core functionality, it provides:

- Audits for uncommitted changes
- Github and Gitlab support including support for bulk organization and repository owner (user) repository scans, as well as pull/merge request scanning for use in common CI workflows.
- Support for private repository scans, and repositories that require key based authentication
- Output in JSON formats for consumption in other reporting tools and frameworks
- Externalised configuration for environment specific customisation including regex rules
- High performance through the use of src-d's go-git framework
